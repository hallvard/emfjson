# Documentation

In this section, we will introducd the basic usage of EMFJson with the EMF API and with the Jackson API and on GWT. 
EMFJson is built on top of the Jackson JSON library and can be used as a Jackson module, but can also be easily used 
from the EMF API. The GWT version of EMFJson does not make use of the Jackson library, as it is intented to be compiled 
as JavaScript, and be used in complement to GWT version of EMF.
